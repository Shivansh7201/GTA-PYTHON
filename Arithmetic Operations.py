# This function rounds a variable number up to the nearest 10x value
def round_up(number):
  x = 10
# The floor division operator will calculate the integer value of
# "number" divided by x: 35 // 10 will return the integer 3.
  whole_number = number // x
# The modulo operator will calculate the remainder value of "number"
# divided by x: 35 % 10 will return the remainder value 5.
  remainder = number % x
# If the remainder is greater than 0: 
  if remainder >= 5: 
# Return x multiplied by the (whole_number+1) to round up
    return x*(whole_number+1)
# Else, return x multiplied by the whole_number to round down
  return x*whole_number
 
# Calls the function with the parameter value of 35.
print(round_up(35)) # Should print 40
